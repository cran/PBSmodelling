The batch files in this directory can facilitate R package development 
under Windows. For more information on building packages, see apendix B 
of the PBS Modelling User Guide*.

Batch files included here:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rcopy.bat           copy developer project to build directory for checking (updated to use robocopy.exe)
RPaths.bat          specify local paths for various programs
RPathCheck.bat      check local paths by looking for key programs
Rcheck.bat          check the source code for errors (w/ CRAN check)
Rcheck0.bat         check the source code for errors (w/out CRAN check)
Rbuild.bat          build the source code into a binary Windows package
Rpack.bat           pack the source code into a source package
Runpack.bat         unpack source code into a package directory tree
RmakePDF.bat        make a PDF from the Rd files
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
If using R-devel:
RdevPaths.bat       specify local paths for various programs
RdevPathCheck.bat   check local paths by looking for key programs
RdevCheck.bat       check the source code for errors (w/ CRAN check; add 'false' to call to disable CRAN check)
RdevBuild.bat       build the source code into a tar.gz file (add 'binary' to call to build a zip)
RdevUnpack.bat      unpack source code into a package directory tree
Rdevgui.bat         run 64-bit R from command line

PBStry package
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
(NOTE: `PBStry' very outdated and likely dysfunctional.)
You can use the small package archived in PBStry_x.xx.tar.gz as a 
convenient prototype for starting your own new package. It includes 
functions with C code called by the R function .C().
