The following is a list of all the underlying functions which are called as a 
result of a user calling an exported function.

.autoConvertMode
  converts strings into numerical reposentation

.buildgrid
  used for building a grid with nested widgets as described by window 
  description list

.catError
  used for displaying parsing errors (with line numbers..)

.convertMatrixListToDataFrame
  converts a "matrix list" into a dataframe - matrix list is a list of lists

.convertMatrixListToMatrix
  converts a "matrix list" into a real matrix

.convertPararmStrToList
  extracts arguments (seperated by space) from a single string into a list, 
  preserving keys and values. whitespace in quotes is preserved

.convertPararmStrToVector
  extracts elements (seperated by space) into a vector, preserving spaces in 
  quotes. Keys are not valid, and are intrupted as values

.createTkFont
  creates a TKFont variable based of a PBS styled font string

.createWidget
  looks for .createWidget.xxx where xxx is the widget type
  Different types:
  .createWidget.button .createWidget.check  .createWidget.data 
  .createWidget.entry  .createWidget.grid   .createWidget.history 
  .createWidget.label  .createWidget.matrix .createWidget.null 
  .createWidget.radio  .createWidget.slide  .createWidget.slideplus 
  .createWidget.text   .createWidget.vector

.extractData
  called by TK on button, bind, onchange,... events - which then calls a user 
  function, once pbs.win is updated

.extractFuns
  Old function used for extracting user function names

.extractVar
  converts values from TK into R values (converts mode, merges multiple 
  variables into vector, matrix, dataframe if named accordingly - foo[1], 
  foo[1,2] or foo[1,2]d (d for data))

.flipMatrix
  flips around the data in a matrix to make it as if it was read byrow instead 
  of bycol

.getArguments
  used for documenting widget arguments (ordering and default value)

.getMatrixListSize
  determines size of matrix needed for the matrixList

.getParamFromStr
  parses a string representing a widget into an equivalent list

.getParamOrder
  returns a list defining all widget arguments and default values

.getPBS.win
  returns an up-to-date PBS.win list

.hash
  generates a hash table that is passed by reference

.inCollection
  searches a vector - No longer in use - replaced by .isReallyNull

.initPBSoptions
  called by zzz.r - prepares the openFile config list.

.isReallyNull
  returns if a key really exists in a list

.matrixHelp
  stores elements of a matrix in a "matrix list" (which is dynamic)

.parsegrid
  grids in list representation have a data argument which is a list of lists of 
  widget lists. First list represents each row, 2nd list represents each column, 
  each element of the 2nd list is a widget. This function organizes widgets into 
  this 2d list

.parsemenu
  used to setup menu lists - similar to parsegrid

.PBSdimnameHelper
  used to name matrix and dataframe objects (with given rowNames and colNames)

.searchCollection
  returns the position of a needle in a haystack (or if needle is a shortened 
  (but still unique) needle)

.setMatrixElement
  used by .setMatrixElement to assign elements from "matrix list" to real matrix

.setWinValHelper
  used by setWinVal to set individual widgets

.stopWidget
  displays an error (similar to .catError) but stops and closes window (this is 
  for run-time errors, rather than parse errors)

.stripComments
  removes any trailing comments (indicated by #) unless # is within a quoted 
  string

.stripSlashes
  parses a string as if it was a quoted character string (returns a single 
  string)

.stripSlashesVec
  parses a string as if it contains substrings (returns a vector of strings)

.trimWhiteSpace
  removes leading and trailing whitespace

.validateWindowDescList
  validates a desc list, and fills in any default values.

.validateWindowDescWidgets
  validates a single widget of the DescList

.writeListOut
  used by compileDescription - it should use dput instead

.writeListOut.matrix
  helper which should be replaced with dput

.writeListOut.vec
  helper which should be replaced with dput
