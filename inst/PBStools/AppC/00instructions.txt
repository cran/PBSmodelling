Files in this directory help to create the file 'AppC.pdf' for Appendix
C in the User's Guide.

The batch file 'makeAPPC.bat' uses the LaTeX files in the distribution
of PBS Modelling to create a single LaTeX file for making 'AppC.pdf'.
Revise 'makeAppC.bat' to reflect paths on your computer, similar to
changes in 'definePaths.bat'.

The batch file uses a subdirectory \Rhelp to hold all LaTeX
documentation files. The contents of \Rhelp are deleted before the files
from the PBS Modelling library are uncompressed and copied. An R script
'makeAppC.r' builds the LaTeX file 'AppC.tex', based on the files in
\Rhelp and additional header and foooter files (AppChead.tex and
AppCfoot.tex). The MiKTeX command 'pdflatex' creates 'AppC.pdf' from
'AppC.tex'.

The header file 'AppChead.tex' must be editted to specify the starting
page number, determined by preceeding pages written with Microsoft Word.
LaTeX style and font definition files come from the current distribution
of R (2.3.1), in the subdirectory \share\texmf. They should probably be
replaced as future versions become available, perhaps with corresponding
changes in AppChead.tex. Some MiKTeX distributions may need to add the
package 'fancyvrb' as support for 'Sweave.sty'.

See the output files 'makeAppC.log' and 'AppC.log' for messages about
the processes of making 'AppC.tex' and 'AppC.pdf', respectively.
