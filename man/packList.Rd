\title{ Pack a List with Objects }
\description{
  Pack a list with existing objects using names only.
}
\usage{
packList(stuff, target="PBSlist", value, 
    lenv=parent.frame(), tenv=.GlobalEnv)
}
\arguments{
  \item{stuff}{ string vector of object names }
  \item{target}{ target list object }
  \item{value}{ an optional explicit value to assign to \code{stuff} }
  \item{lenv}{ local environment where objects are located }
  \item{tenv}{ target environment where target list is or will be located }
}
\details{
  A list object called \code{target} will be located in the 
  \code{tenv} environment. The objects named in \code{stuff} and 
  located in the \code{lenv} environment will appear as named 
  components within the list object \code{target}.
  
  If an explicit \code{value} is specified, the function uses this value
  instead of looking for local objects. Essentially, \code{stuff=value}
  which is then packed into \code{target}.
}
\value{
  No value is returned
